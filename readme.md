#### Image Content Classification with Tensorflow

Application of Google-made image content classifier built with Tensorflow. Training this kind of model in home conditions would took an eternity, that's why it was downloaded from 
[official website](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/image_recognition). Model accuracy is amazing.

#### CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS

1. Image Input Shape - 128,128,3, activation - relu
2. Three additional Convolutional Layers (batch size - respectively 32,64,128, dropout rate - 0.25,0.2,0.3)
3. Units in hidden layer - 128
4. Compiler - optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'binary_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy']
5. Acc - 89% Loss - 25% (approx 30min/epoch on GPU)
6. CNN Code Location: deep_learning/ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork.py
